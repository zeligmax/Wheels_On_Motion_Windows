# Wheels On Motion (Windows App) 🎶🖥️

**Wheels On Motion – Windows Edition** is the sound-generation companion app for the artistic project *Wheels On Motion*.  

This desktop application transforms wheelchair motion data (captured via the companion Android APK) into **immersive soundscapes**, using audio synthesis and visualization techniques.

---

## 🎛 What It Does
Once you load a `.txt` or `.csv` file exported from the Android app, the program allows you to:

- 📂 **Load data** captured from wheelchair movement.
- 🎵 **Play individual columns** of data as sound.
- 🎶 **Mix multiple columns** into complex sound textures.
- 💾 **Export audio** to `.wav` format (either single columns or multi-column mixes).
- 📊 **Visualize frequency spectra (FFT)** of the generated sound in real time.
- 🎚 Control playback duration via **BPM** or **total time**.

This app provides both **analytical** and **artistic** tools to reinterpret mobility data as audible form.

## 🖥️ Installation
1. Download or clone this repository.  
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
(Typical dependencies: tkinter, numpy, matplotlib, sounddevice, scipy)
3. Run the app with:

bash
Copiar
Editar
python main.py
📤 Input Data
The input should be .txt or .csv files generated by the Android Wheels On Motion app.

Example data includes:

🌍 Latitude, 🌐 Longitude, 🏔 Altitude

🎛 Gyroscope (X, Y, Z)

These signals become the raw material for sound synthesis.

🔊 Features
Real-time playback of mobility-derived sound.

Stop button ⏹️ for immediate control.

Modern dashboard UI with sidebar navigation and icon support.

Audio export in high-quality .wav format.

Frequency spectrum visualization (FFT up to 2000 Hz).

🎨 Artistic Intent
Mobility becomes audible.

This desktop app interprets wheelchair movement as sound:

Pitch reflects vibration and slope.

Rhythm emerges from irregularities in motion.

Texture grows from spatial variability.

Through this, architecture and terrain are transformed into audible expression, revealing the invisible challenges of navigating everyday environments.

⚠️ Permissions
The Windows app itself does not require special permissions.
However, make sure the input data is accessible (from Documents, Downloads, or a custom folder).
